                    Hello I'm Swinny, a developer who enjoys working on projects and expirmenting with new technologies. For real work I am currently employed by the United Services Automobile Association. However, I enjoy working on many projects outside of work as developing new and fun technologies is a passion of mine. This website is a sort of development diary for all of the projects I have worked on that I think are cool.

                    You can view more details of a project by clicking on the project card. Some projects will have demos and some may just have pictures. Some may not even be totally complete. Like I explained before though this is just sort of a catalog of things I have done that I think are cool.
